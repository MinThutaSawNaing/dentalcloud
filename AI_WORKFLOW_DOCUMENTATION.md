## Overview

The Dental Cloud application is a comprehensive dental clinic management system with an integrated AI assistant (Loli) designed to help dental professionals with clinical decision support, administrative tasks, and data analysis. The system handles patient management, appointments, treatments, inventory, and financial operations.

### Core Features:
- Patient management with medical histories
- Appointment scheduling and management
- Treatment recording and tracking
- Inventory management for medicines and supplies
- Financial operations and reporting
- Immutable payment receipts with treatment and medicine line snapshots
- Doctor scheduling and management
- Loyalty program management
- AI-powered clinical assistance

## Architecture & Components

### AI Assistant View (AIAssistantView.tsx)
The main component responsible for AI interactions, featuring:
- Dual-mode operation: Ask Mode (read-only analysis) and Agent Mode (CRUD operations)
- Context-aware conversation management
- Markdown-enhanced response rendering
- Session management and history
- Speech-to-text functionality
- Mock API simulation for development

### Core Data Models
- **Patient**: Personal information, medical history, contact details, balance, loyalty points
- **Appointment**: Patient-doctor-date-time relationship with status tracking
- **ClinicalRecord/Treatment**: Treatment descriptions, costs, teeth involved
- **PaymentRecord**: Payment amount/type, balance movement, receipt number, collector, and optional immutable receipt snapshot
- **Doctor**: Medical professionals with specializations, schedules, and commission percentage
- **TreatmentType**: Standardized treatment procedures with costs
- **Medicine**: Inventory items with stock levels, pricing, categories
- **Expense**: Business expenses with categories and dates
- **User**: System users with roles and permissions

## Business Workflows

### 1. Patient Management Workflow
**Primary Operations:**
- Patient registration and profile creation
- Medical history documentation
- Contact information management
- Balance and payment tracking
- Loyalty point management
- Registration-date, doctor, treatment, and text filtering for the patient list

**Key Processes:**
```
1. Patient Inquiry
2. Registration (if new patient)
3. Medical History Review
4. Treatment Planning
5. Appointment Scheduling
6. Treatment Execution
7. Payment Processing
8. Follow-up Scheduling
```

**AI Integration Points:**
- Patient search and lookup
- Medical history analysis
- Balance checking
- Loyalty program management
- Patient communication templates

**Patient List Filtering:**
- **New** shows patients registered today.
- **From / To** applies an inclusive registration-date range and also supports a one-sided range.
- Date filters can be combined with doctor, treatment, and text-search filters.
- Patient PDF and Excel exports use the currently filtered list.

### 2. Appointment Scheduling Workflow
**Primary Operations:**
- Booking appointments between registered patients and doctors
- Booking unregistered marketing lead appointments with guest name, phone, source, and follow-up notes without creating a patient record first
- Rescheduling and cancellation
- Status tracking (Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled)
- Availability checking for doctors

**Updated Admin Appointment Form:**
- The appointment modal starts with **Appointment For**: choose **Registered Patient** for an existing patient record or **New Patient** for an unregistered lead.
- Registered Patient appointments require selecting the patient. New Patient lead appointments require **New Patient Name** and **New Patient Phone**, with optional **New Patient Source** and **New Patient Follow-up Notes**.
- Doctor selection is optional and uses a searchable doctor field; the appointment can be saved with no specific doctor.
- Scheduling fields are **Date**, **Time**, **Type**, **Status**, and **Branch / Location**. Status values are Scheduled, Completed, and Cancelled; Scheduled is the normal default.
- Appointment clinical details are stored in structured notes as **Clinical Focus** and **Extra Notes**. When the AI creates appointments, it should populate `clinical_focus` and `n` / `extra_notes` so the form can parse them back correctly.
- Appointments do not collect target teeth. Teeth are recorded later on treatment/clinical records.
- Lead appointments stay as appointment-only records until converted. Do not create a patient profile for a New Patient / lead appointment unless the user explicitly asks to register or convert that lead.
- Completing a registered-patient appointment considers the per-visit clinical fee. The first completed visit uses the new-patient price and later completed visits use the returning-patient price. Only waive it on an explicit user request.
- Admin Dashboard > **Recalls & Cancels** reuses appointment data: Upcoming Recalls are future Scheduled registered-patient appointments from Clinical Focus next appointment; Late / No-show are past Scheduled appointments including unregistered leads. Cancelled appointments start in **Needs Follow-up** and staff can move them to **No Show**, **Rescheduled**, or **Completed Later**. Completed Later must link to a later Completed appointment for the same registered patient; the original appointment remains Cancelled.

**Key Processes:**
```
1. Patient Identification
2. Doctor Selection
3. Time Slot Selection
4. Appointment Creation
5. Confirmation
6. Pre-visit Reminders
7. Status Updates
8. Follow-up Scheduling
```

**AI Integration Points:**
- Availability checking
- Conflict resolution
- Bulk appointment scheduling
- Doctor workload balancing

### 3. Treatment Recording Workflow
**Primary Operations:**
- Recording completed treatments
- Associated tooth numbering
- Cost calculation and billing
- Medicine prescription and dispensing
- Treatment history maintenance

**Key Processes:**
```
1. Patient Verification
2. Clinical Examination
3. Treatment Planning
4. Treatment Execution
5. Documentation
6. Billing/Payment Processing
7. Follow-up Recommendation
8. Progress Tracking
```

**AI Integration Points:**
- Treatment type suggestions
- Cost estimation
- Medicine inventory checks
- Clinical protocol guidance
- Insurance claim preparation

### Detailed Treatment Analysis Workflow
**Navigation and scope:**
- Open **Overview**, find **Treatment Mix (Range)**, then select **More Detail**.
- The read-only report uses the inclusive **Date From**, **Date To**, and **Report Scope** controls from Overview. Date changes reload an open report; changing Report Scope returns to Overview, where **More Detail** must be selected again.
- Loli can explain the screen, but no assistant action opens it or changes its filters.

**Metric meanings:**
- **Performed** is the number of saved treatment records, not appointments, teeth, or unique visits.
- The multiple-treatment-record patient share is the percentage of distinct patients with more than one treatment record in range. Multiple records can be from one visit, so this is not a return, retention, repeat-visit, or loyalty rate without separate visit evidence.
- **Patients** is distinct patients for each treatment. **Production** is recorded treatment value, **Average** is production per performance, and **Share** is the treatment's percentage of all performances in scope.
- Discounted and FOC records are separate. FOC is not also counted as discounted, and Unassigned is visible in the doctor breakdown without increasing distinct-doctor totals.
- Tooth frequency counts a tooth once per treatment record. The time trend plots dates that contain treatment activity.
- Single-branch reports preserve treatment-type identity and support legacy name-based records. **All Branches** combines matching branch-local services by normalized treatment name.

**Data boundaries and errors:**
- The screen pages through the complete selected date range. Assistant Practice Data can contain only a recent subset and must not be presented as an exact copy of the screen totals.
- The screen does not calculate clinical success rates, outcomes, diagnoses, profit, collections, or seasonal comparisons. Production must not be described as collected payment.
- A genuine empty range asks the user to widen the dates. Loading failures show **Try again** and must not be reported as zero activity.

### 4. Inventory Management Workflow
**Primary Operations:**
- Medicine/Supply tracking
- Stock level monitoring
- Reordering alerts
- Sales tracking
- Expiration date management

**Key Processes:**
```
1. Initial Stock Setup
2. Usage Tracking
3. Low Stock Alerts
4. Reorder Suggestions
5. Purchase Order Generation
6. Stock Receiving
7. Inventory Auditing
8. Expiration Monitoring
```

**AI Integration Points:**
- Automated reorder suggestions
- Stock level optimization
- Supplier recommendations
- Cost analysis
- Fast-moving item identification

### 5. Financial Operations Workflow
**Primary Operations:**
- Payment processing
- Required payment-type capture
- Immutable payment receipt snapshots and historical reprints
- Revenue tracking
- Expense management
- Financial reporting
- Insurance claims processing

**Key Processes:**
```
1. Service/Billing Generation
2. Payment Collection
3. Revenue Recording
4. Expense Tracking
5. Account Reconciliation
6. Financial Reporting
7. Tax Preparation
8. Audit Trail Maintenance
```

**AI Integration Points:**
- Revenue forecasting
- Expense categorization
- Profit margin analysis
- Financial trend identification
- Payment plan recommendations

**Current Payment and Receipt Rules:**
- Supported payment types are KPay, WavePay, Cash, MMQR, Debit Card, Credit Card, AYA Pay, and UAB Pay. A payment type is required.
- Saved payment receipts preserve a historical snapshot containing clinic/patient details, amount paid, payment type, full/partial status, balances, collector, and captured treatment and medicine lines.
- Reprints use the stored snapshot so later profile, settings, treatment, medicine, or balance edits do not alter the original receipt.
- Receipt selection supports treatments and standalone medicine sales.
- A receipt item's **Recent / NEW** marker applies only when its item date is today in the clinic's local calendar.
- Receipt header title, currency, and A4/55 mm/80 mm thermal format are shared clinic settings across devices. New receipts use the current settings; old saved snapshots retain their original values.
